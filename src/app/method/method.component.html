      <h1>The Duet Format</h1>
      <p>The Divertimento Duets concept breaks away from the traditional violin/piano accompaniment format, instead presenting a fun and effective way of learning the violin that involves complete interaction between teacher and pupil.</p>
      <p>These duets are intended for the teacher and pupil to play together without relying on a piano accompaniment to complete the piece; in this way, the pupil can emulate the teacher’s style at every opportunity, while stimulating the desire to practise and persevere through a sense of achievement and enjoyment.</p>
      <p>Using this method the pupil will develop a more fluid performance style, excellent intonation and in general, a fully rounded technique.</p>
      <p>This is not only a more immersive approach to violin learning, it also helps to develop the pupil’s ability to play with and listen to others from the very start. It is also the perfect tool for a teacher who does not have access to a piano.</p>

      <h1>Teaching using Divertimento Duets</h1>
      <p>The Divertimento Duets were written to be used in a range of scenarios.</p>
      <p>Both parts are of equal difficulty for beginner violin; not a simple student part accompanied by a more difficult teacher’s part. This makes them extremely flexible;</p>

    <h2>Perfect for one-on-one lessons:</h2>
    <p>Using Divertimento Duets you can play along with your students at every opportunity, allowing them to emulate your style and teaching them to breathe with you and make music from the very beginning rather than just playing notes on a page.</p>
    <p>As both parts are of equal difficulty, they can learn both parts and by playing with you, hear how the music fits together.</p>

    <p>This means that your students are gradually mastering all the necessary aspects of violin technique but are also taking their first important steps towards ensemble playing.</p>

    <p>Divertimento Duets are a great way to interact musically with others, having fun while making music together.</p>
    <p>Two beginner violinists who want to meet up outside of their lessons to make music together can have hours of fun with these duets.</p>

      <h1>The Decision to use illustrations</h1>
      <p>Lorna’s unique illustrations are an integral part of the Divertimento Duets books.</p>
      <p>She designed these illustrations to be completely inclusive by creating them in a style that would be appreciated by both child and adult learner.</p>
      <p>These illustrations then become a precious addition to the book, allowing it to become something beautiful to own as well as to use, no matter what age you decide to start your journey.</p>
      <p> If the book is something you love looking at, that can be an added incentive to get it on the stand and start practising.</p>
