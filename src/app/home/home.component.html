    <h2>The Method</h2>
    <div class="leftText">
      <p>3 Decades of violin teaching have inspired Phil Holland to develop Divertimento Duets, a
        new and original approach to learning and teaching the violin.</p>
      <p>This method is great fun for the student and an excellent and useful resource for the teacher.
        It breaks away from the traditional format of violin with piano accompaniment in order to
        encourage a more immersive experience between teacher and student, allowing for an
        organic and natural development of the student’s style.</p>

    <h3>Original Duets for Beginner Violin</h3>
    <p class="leftText">These are completely new and original duets for the beginner violinist, structured to allow the
      student to gradually master new aspects of violin technique and musicianship.</p>
  </div>

  <div fxFlex="1 1 50%" fxFlexAlign="center" class="centerText padder">
    <h3>No need for piano accompaniment</h3>
    <div class="leftText">
      <p>Not every teacher has access to a piano during lessons and not every teacher is overly confident
        about their ability to accompany at the piano. If this sounds familiar, then you will find Divertimento
        Duets ideal for you and your pupils.</p>
      <p>The duet format also encourages complete interaction between teacher and pupil which helps
        develop:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a more fluid performance style</li>
        <li>excellent intonation</li>
        <li>a fully rounded technique</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div fxFlex="1 1 50%" fxFlexAlign="center" class="centerText padder">
    <h3>Perfect for one-on-one lessons, group teaching or just for fun</h3>
    <div class="leftText">
      <p>The two parts of each duet are of equal difficulty. As such it can be used as a violin teaching manual
        in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>one-on-one lessons</li>
        <li>group teaching</li>
        <li>first steps towards ensemble playing</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By learning both parts of each duet, the student will gain a better understanding of how music fits
        together and feel a great sense of achievement and enjoyment.</p>

    <h3>Ideal first performance pieces</h3>
    <p class="leftText">These duets are fun to play and enjoyable to listen to. This makes them ideal first performance
      pieces that would be well suited to both child and adult beginners.</p>

    <h3>Beautiful and original full colour illustrations</h3>
    <p class="leftText">Lorna Romanenghi’s beautiful and unique illustrations really help to bring these duets to life
      on the
      page. Divertimento Duets is a violin book a student will love playing but also cherish.</p>

      downloads from this website. The teacher’s notes may also be useful to parents and more mature
      beginners in order to give them insight into the learning process.</p>

    <h3>&quot;Most original, extremely well thought out and beautifully presented.</h3>
    <p class="leftText">Phil has used her long experience of the teaching of the
      violin to children to write this delightful book. The concept behind her
      creation explores the many aspects of music making, and the idea of 2
      equal parts will open the door to friendship and the wonderful world of
      music at its most valuable.  I&#39;m sure that many teachers will find
      inspiration and ideas from this project. The presentation of the book is
      very attractive and beautifully illustrated, and the accompanying
      material and notes most interesting and informative. Divertimento Duets
      is a most valuable and original addition to the beginner violin repertoire.&quot;</p>
